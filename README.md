# Dialog Split

**Dialog Split** is a short top-down adventure prototype built in **Godot 3.3**.  
You play as a lone figure lost in a forest, interacting with characters to uncover bits of story and find your way out.

> This is not a full game — it’s a **technical prototype** focused on testing a **custom branching dialog system** and interaction flow.
