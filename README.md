# Dialog Split

**Dialog Split** is a short top-down adventure prototype built in **Godot 3.3**.  
You play as a lone figure lost in a forest, interacting with characters to uncover bits of story and find your way out.

> This is not a full game — it’s a **technical prototype** focused on testing a **custom branching dialog system** and interaction flow.

---

### Features
- Two dialog systems:
  - **Custom-built system** created from scratch 
  - **Inky-integrated system** using the Inkle narrative format for branching storytelling  
- Branching conversations and simple interaction logic  
- Minimal top-down exploration environment  

---

### Status
Prototype built for experimentation — not a complete or polished game.  

---

### Controls
- **Move:** WASD / Arrow keys  
- **Interact:** E
- **Select dialog options:** Mouse

### Notes
The **dialog systems** are documented in Scenes/DialogSystemScene/README.md
