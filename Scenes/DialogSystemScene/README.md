# Dialog Systems — Dialog Split

## 1. Custom Godot Dialog System

This dialog system was built entirely in Godot for **Dialog Split**. 
It allows for branching conversations and interaction flow without relying on external tools

### Features
- Fully designed and implemented in Godot  
- Supports branching dialogs and basic conditional logic  
- Designed to be used directly with NPCs
  

## 2. Inky-Integrated Dialog System

This dialog system uses **Inky** and **Godot** via the inkgd addon.
It is designed to handle **branching conversations** and story-driven interactions for NPCs in **Dialog Split**.

### Features
- Integrates Inky stories into Godot using inkgd  
- Supports branching dialogs  
- The system can be tested freely in a seperate scene  
- Currently, integration with NPCs is done manually
- Future plan: provide editor tools to integrate the dialog system directly into NPCs.
